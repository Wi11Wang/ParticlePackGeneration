abstract = {We present a new algorithm, called marching cubes, that creates triangle models of constant density surfaces from 3D medical data. Using a divide-and-conquer approach to generate inter-slice connectivity, we create a case table that defines triangle topology. The algorithm processes the 3D medical data in scan-line order and calculates triangle vertices using linear interpolation. We find the gradient of the original data, normalize it, and use it as a basis for shading the models. The detail in images produced from the generated surface models is the result of maintaining the inter-slice connectivity, surface data, and gradient information present in the original 3D data. Results from computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MR), and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) illustrate the quality and functionality of marching cubes. We also discuss improvements that decrease processing time and add solid modeling capabilities.},

  abstract = {Many applications in computer graphics require complex, highly detailed models. However, the level of detail actually necessary may vary considerably. To control processing time, it is often desirable to use approximations in place of excessively detailed models.We have developed a surface simplification algorithm which can rapidly produce high quality approximations of polygonal models. The algorithm uses iterative contractions of vertex pairs to simplify models and maintains surface error approximations using quadric matrices. By contracting arbitrary vertex pairs (not just edges), our algorithm is able to join unconnected regions of models. This can facilitate much better approximations, both visually and with respect to geometric error. In order to allow topological joining, our system also supports non-manifold surface models.},

abstract = {Microfocus Computer Tomography (μCT) is a non-destructive imaging technique that allows visualisation of internal features within non-transparent objects such as sedimentary rocks. With resolution as good as 10μm in three dimensions, this technique is highly superior to medical CT widely used in geology and material sciences. Superior resolution is achieved by decreasing the X-ray spot size, which allows a decrease in the penumbra effect and an increase in primary magnification by placing the sample close to the X-ray source. Since polychromatic X-ray sources are used, the technique is not free of artefacts. Application of filtering techniques is recommended to circumvent these artefacts and to achieve good quality images for quantitative analysis. Application of a dual energy approach allows quantification of density as well as effective atomic number distribution of internal features. As the technique acquires data in 3D, μCT provides an ideal tool to link 2D thin-section petrography to 3D petrophysical measurements or to be used within an upscaling approach. A number of applications and the use of dual energy density and effective atomic number characterisations are presented. Attention is also paid to some of the limitations of this technique.}

abstract = {Computer vision (CV)-based safety monitoring has been widely applied at construction sites. However, this method requires large, diverse, and accurately labeled training data, which is difficult or expensive to collect from real-world environments. To address this concern, this paper introduces a synthetic data generation methodology driven by game engines, facilitating the simulation of diverse construction scenarios from varying distances and viewpoints. Subsequently, a CV model is trained on hybrid datasets encompassing both synthetic and real-world data, thereby evaluating its viability for safeguarding construction workers by particularly detecting small-sized personal protective equipment. Through the incorporation of synthetic data, a detection performance enhancement of up to 30.4%p is achieved, an encouraging outcome with substantial potential to impact worker safety. The outcome of this investigation possess the capacity to refine the safety and overall welfare of construction workers, delivering a cost-efficient and streamlined means to train CV models tailored for safety monitoring purposes.}
